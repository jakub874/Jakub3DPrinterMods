|1. Remove your top panel from your printer, keep the stock foam strip as is, DO NOT remove it. Set the panel to the side. | <br /> *[intentionally left blank]* <br /> <br />
|2. Remove the support strip from the "base" parts as pictured. | ![alt text](https://github.com/jakub874/Jakub3DPrinterMods/blob/main/Tophat/img/Screenshot%202023-01-28%20234559.png?raw=true)
|3. Attach the base pieces to the printer using the roll-in nuts and m3x8 screws. The screws go into the holes marked in the picture. | ![alt text](https://github.com/jakub874/Jakub3DPrinterMods/blob/main/Tophat/img/Screenshot%202023-01-28%20235321.png?raw=true)
|4. Lay foam tape along the step in the base parts. This helps provide a seal when the panel is installed. | ![alt text](https://github.com/jakub874/Jakub3DPrinterMods/blob/main/Tophat/img/Screenshot%202023-01-29%20000729.png?raw=true)
|5. Press the 6x3mm magnets into the base piece into the holes as highlighted in the picture. It is recommended to keep them all the same polarity for ease of assembly. | ![alt text](https://github.com/jakub874/Jakub3DPrinterMods/blob/main/Tophat/img/Screenshot%202023-01-28%20235627.png?raw=true)
|6. Press the 6x3mm magnets into the frame pieces. Ensure that they are opposite of that of the base piece so that they attract. | ![alt text](https://github.com/jakub874/Jakub3DPrinterMods/blob/main/Tophat/img/Screenshot%202023-01-29%20000252.png?raw=true)
|7. Drive the m3x30 screws into each dowel pin. Get the dowel pins from the k3 repo (link in README.md under BOM). | <br /> *[intentionally left blank]* <br /> <br />
|8. Assemble the panel frame using the dowel pins and super glue. Hot glue is doable but very difficult as it solidifies too quickly. | ![alt text](https://github.com/jakub874/Jakub3DPrinterMods/blob/main/Tophat/img/Screenshot%202023-01-29%20000215.png?raw=true)
|9. Place the tophat frame on the printer and lay the vhb tape on the lower step (closest towards the center of the panel) in the "corner" and "edge" pieces. The foam strip that is already attached to your top panel will rest on the small upper step. | ![alt text](https://github.com/jakub874/Jakub3DPrinterMods/blob/main/Tophat/img/Screenshot%202023-01-28%20234456.png?raw=true)
|10. Place the tophat frame on the printer frame onto the tophat base pieces, the magnets should attract. Place your top panel onto the tophat frame and press it into the VHB tape. | ![alt text](https://github.com/jakub874/Jakub3DPrinterMods/blob/main/Tophat/img/Screenshot%202023-01-29%20002005.png?raw=true)
